For the first time in his 24 years as a wine maker, Stephan saw these grapes fermenting in the same tank. The result is a seamless, complex work of art. Fresh aromas of plums, macerated blackberries, and blueberries in the nose, and dark, intense fruit on the palate. The mouth and lengthy finish are made more complex by hints of leather, tar, and tobacco leaf. An augmentation of Petit Verdot puts the 2004 on the classic track of the 2001 vintage."

Radiant color and soaring aromas of ripe blackberry, toasty oak spices, black truffle and cappuccino make an impressive entr\u00e9e.  Fleshy and supple at first, the wine expands into deeper, more concentrated fruit layers with chocolaty, fine-grained tannins."

Running on high octane aromas and built on an iron block with deep reserves of black fruit this 100% Cabernet blend delivers 700 horsepower at the wheels. Coming off idle the nose slowly explodes with sappy dark and rustic berries, clove, cedar and sweet oak spices. Forged, ripe fruit pistons pump out the power for miles until finally finishing with an impressive band of ported and polished tannins. Motor must be warmed-up before driving!"
